# Technical Interview Challenges (Junior Dev)

_A collection of technical interview challenges oriented towards hiring a Jr. Developer_

## ⚙️ Instructions

In each directory you will find a unique challenge scenario.

To try out the challenge, simply look inside of the directory to find a `README.md` file with an explanation of the challenge.

Each challenge will feature an abililty to test your code with a command that should be performed from the root of this project.

Each challenge is oriented around about a half-hour time length, and ideally should be performed with a mid or senior dev who can be a resource for help.

Remember, the goal is not perfection. The goal is to give see how a Jr. Developer problem solves with another developer as an immediate resource.

Happy coding!
